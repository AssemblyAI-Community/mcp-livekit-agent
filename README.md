# [Voice Agent with OpenAI, LiveKit Agents, and MCP](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/mcp-voice-agent-openai-livekit)

A voice agent implementation that uses LiveKit Agents Framework to create an intelligent conversational assistant with database capabilities.

## Overview

This repository contains the code for a voice agent that leverages:

- **LiveKit Agents:** For real-time infrastructure and agent framework
- **AssemblyAI:** For fast and accurate real-time Speech-to-Text
- **OpenAI:** For language understanding and generation (LLM)
- **OpenAI TTS:** For giving the agent a voice
- **Supabase MCP:** For database interactions via Model Context Protocol

The agent follows a Speech-to-Text → LLM → Text-to-Speech pipeline and can interact with Supabase databases through natural language commands.
